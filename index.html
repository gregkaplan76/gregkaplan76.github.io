					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p class="intro">Hi my name is Greg, and I built this website! I grew up and currently live in the pacific northwest. I'm currently pursuing a career within the multimedia and web-design realm. I take pride in attempting to be in a state of constant improvement both personally and career wise. </p>
					<p>This website is intended to showcase my web design/development abilities to fortify my resume, and the ability to get to know me a little bit .</p>
					<h3> Some things I enjoy outside of work:</h3>
					<section class="page">
							<ul class="menu">
							<li> 
								<button class="accordion-control">Cars</button>
								<div class="accordion-panel" style="display: none;">
								<p>I have always loved <strong>cars</strong>. Growing up I had a large hot wheel collection I would play with for hours on end, and dreampt of having some of my own real automobiles someday. Now as a young adult, cars and the car culture are a huge part of my life, currently having 3 cars myself. These include a: <strong>1979 Volvo 264 GL</strong>, <strong>2011 VW Jetta Sportwagon TDI</strong>, and a <strong>2005 Pontiac GTO.</strong></p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<button class="accordion-control">Photography</button>
								<div class="accordion-panel" style="display: none;">
								<p>For as long as I can remember I've had an appreciation for great <strong>photography</strong>, photo editing, and the equipment necessary for both. I've also always had an eye for producing great photos. It wasn't until a few years ago when I saw a superzoom video from a <strong>Nikon P1000</strong> that I was seriously contemplating purchasing one. In 2021 I finally made the purchase when I was enrolled in a photography class and needed a DSLR camera. Review my <strong>"Photography"</strong> page to see some of my past shots.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<button class="accordion-control">Gaming</button>
								<div class="accordion-panel" style="display: none;">
								<p>Through the course of my life, I've truly been able to experience the evolution of <strong>video gaming.</strong> The first consoles I remember playing as a kid were: <strong>Atari</strong>, <strong>N-64</strong>, and the <strong>PS1</strong>. Throughout the years I've collected, or have played on just about every console available to the consumer market. If I have extra free time throughout the course of my busy days, I play online with freinds primarily on <strong>X-box</strong>, and <strong>PC</strong>.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<button class="accordion-control">Cooking</button>
								<div class="accordion-panel" style="display: none;">
								<p>As I've become older and more knowledgeable, I've realized the importance of healthy living and eating. A huge and widely overlooked aspect that helps people live healthily, is the ability to <strong>cook</strong>. I fell in love with cooking after I made my first pot of the Olive Garden copycat <strong>"Zuppa Toscana"</strong> in a highschool cooking class. It amazed me how flavorful and savory this creamy soup was, and that I had the ability to sucessfully produce the dish. That same feeling still encourages me to make new dishes to this day. A couple of my current staples include <strong>chef salads</strong>, and <strong>garlicky wild-caught sockeye salmon.</strong> The wide spectrum of cooking has also peaked my interest and skill in other areas such as <strong>quality cutlery</strong> (blade smithing, blade sharpening techniques, honing, metallurgy, etc), <strong>modern and antique kitchen appliances</strong>, etc. </p>
